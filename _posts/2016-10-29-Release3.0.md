title: Release v3.0
---

v3.0 has been released ! This version mostly consists of a vast code refactoring: a real graph is now implemented internally (it was a collection of nodes previously) leading to a far cleaner code.

Some helpful enhancements were also implemented:

  * ability to pull in parallel (use --mt)
  * upgrade with a different channel (use --alpha or --beta)
  * warning when view creation leads to empty selection
  * ability to detect modified repositories and then build only some artifacts

v3.0 is a new foundation for full-build with a formal features versioning. So, what's coming next ?

  * v3.1 - user experience improvements : static views, indexing/conversion simplification, runtime dependencies retrieval
  * v3.2 - docker support : will enable docker image artifact and push to registry

Meanwhile, the team is looking for people to help on those areas !

  * documentation : it's rather incomplete (see [wiki](https://github.com/full-build/full-build/wiki))
  * Visual Studio plugin : we'd like to have a VS plugin to help adding/removing project reference & NuGet, creating views... 
  * Core : we have a lot of ideas but missing people to implement them. If you know or want to learn F#, please contribute !
  * Site : documentation, blog, presentation

Contributors for v3.0 release:

  * Pierre Chalamet
  * Sergii Salata
