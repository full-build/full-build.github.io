v4.1 has been released ! This version simplify master repository management as for 4.0 but this time, for applications.

# Applications
Applications are now stored alongside repositories. This will avoid hitting master repository when a new application is added.

# Enhancements
Some bug fixes and enhancements have been added:

  * Fix missing eol in paket.dependencies
  * Packages (aka Nugets) are now protected with readonly
  * Hardlink has been deprecated as this was causing some problems
  * Doctor is better than ever !

# Next
Next version will be 5.0 and will support build orchestration. This will likely be implemented as a yaml file with the build steps (Ã  la appveyor or travis).
  
# Contributors for v4.1 release

  * Pierre Chalamet
